# Doug

Doug is a vector sprite.

He is made of three things: 

* One Typescript file
* One CSS stylesheet
* An HTML5 template containing the vector path information

This works great with webpack as there are no actual SVG files or images. The result is a very small tree of living vector components which are easy to edit and organize. Welcome to Doug's world! 

#### Links

* Coming Soon

#### Libraries

* [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) as the structural framework
* [Webpack Module Bundler](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) as the static asset generator

> When Angular2 animation is ready, we'll be adding that into the mix.

#### Install

First, make sure you have the latest [Node](https://nodejs.org)

* `git clone git@github.com:sonipa/doug.git`

#### Edit

* `npm start` will start the server locally - you're on your way to Detectives

#### Deploy
